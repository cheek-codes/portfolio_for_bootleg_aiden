### This project was for a fellow programmer who wanted a site for his portfolio that only shows his projects, and nothing else. He wanted only the source code where he could add in his own work.


## What I used
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT


## Optimizations
If it was up to me, I would have made this into a resume site for potential employers or recruiters to see. 

## Lesson Learned:
I learned code manipulation
